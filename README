Testing Instructions
========================================

Connect to the application as explained in the 'Running the application on the EC2' section below.

Please use Chrome. We have not yet tackled cross-browser compatibility, so we cannot guarantee correct functionality if you use any other browser. The UI design is not yet complete, so the appearance will be somewhat rough around the edges.

Things to test:

Chore and Shift creation:
1. Are chores and shifts properly created?
2. Do they get shown on other relevant pages (Shift allocation, Manage shifts)?

Manage Shifts:
1. Do all shifts get displayed correctly?
2. Are colors correct?

Shift Allocation
1. Can you drag and drop resident names onto the shift calendar?
2. Can you highlight a box on the calendar by clicking on it, click on a resident name, and have that name jump to the highlighted box?
3. Does the resident's name disappear from the list and appear in the right place on the shift calendar each time you do one of the above things?
4. Is an assignment created each time you do one of the above things?
5. Is the appropriate assignment deleted when you click the "x" button on a resident's name in a box on the calendar?
